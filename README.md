### Hi!ðŸ‘‹
I'm Xyrell Joi Quirona, but you may call me Xy. I am an upcoming third year college student next school year and currently taking a bachelor degree in Information Systems. My goal is to learn git and GitHub and be able to collaborate on open source. Programming languages that I learned so far are: **Java, SQL, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS**. :))
